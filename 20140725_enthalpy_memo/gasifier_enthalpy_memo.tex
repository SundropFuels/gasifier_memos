In order to obtain an understanding if the main driving force for conversion of biomass to syngas is driven by kinetic or heat transfer limitations, an experimental matrix was designed to test different levels of maximum residence time and the maximum possible enthalpy change of the reactants.  Experimental results shine light on fundamental driving forces for carbon conversion and tar and methane production in the laboratory gasification system.  It was found that the total enthalpy load on the reactor was the primary driving force for carbon conversion, and lower loads led to higher conversions.  Changing residence times did not affect carbon yield or carbon release.  Finally, both residence time and enthalpy load were found to be significant factors in the production of methane and tars in the laboratory system, and some explanation is given in the text.

\label{factorial}
\end{figure}

It was desired to create a two factorial matrix with a center point with the two axes representing maximum residence time (t$_{res,max}$) and maximum enthalpy change ($\Delta$H$_{max}$).  The matrix can be seen in Figure \ref{factorial}.  Partial pressure of steam and partial pressure of CO$_2$ were held constant for these experiments at 7 psi and 30 psi, respectively.  These pressures were chosen because a large number of previous gasification experiments had partial pressures of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O near these values.  

Because of the large number of possible set points in the laboratory gasifier system that would effect both the space time and maximum enthalpy simultaneously, it would have been difficult to manually design this experimental matrix.  To aid in the design, a large number of potential gasifier experiments were simulated using Sundrop Fuels' gasifier analysis software suite.  First, a flow rate of CO$_2$ was randomly assigned using a uniform distribution with a minimum possible flow rate of 3 SLPM and a maximum flow rate of 6.6 SLPM.  The partial pressure of CO$_2$ was set at 7 psi, and the appropriate flow rate of steam to lead to a partial pressure of 30 psi was found with Equation \ref{eq_steam}.

\begin{equation}
	\dot{n}_{H_2O} = \dot{n}_{CO_2} \times \frac{P_{H_2O}}{P_{CO_2}}
	\label{eq_steam}
\end{equation}

The flow rate of Argon was set at 2 SLPM for all experiments.  Biomass flow rate was randomized uniformly between 2 lbs/hr and 4 lbs/hr.  The total flow rate of entrainment gas was set to be 6 SLPM for every 1 lb/hr of biomass, which was found to be a good minimum entrainment flow rate in previous experiments using the brush feeder.  The remainder of the entrainment gas which isn't CO$_2$ was set as nitrogen.

Steam temperature was set at 500 $^\circ$C, and makeup nitrogen was uniformly randomized between 0 and 20 SLPM.  The total pressure was found using the partial pressure of steam and the total flow rate of gas into the system (Equation \ref{pressure}).  The maximum residence time and the maximum enthalpy change were calculated for each simulated run using Sundrop Fuel's gasifier analysis software.  Experiments which could not be run due to system limitations were removed from the potential runs, and enthalpy and maximum residence time targets were chosen to maximize the change in each measure.  Set points for all experiments are outlined in Appendix \ref{app_experiments}.

\begin{equation}
	P_{tot} = P_{H_2O} \times \frac{\dot{n}_{tot}}{\dot{n}_{H_2O}}
	\label{pressure}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Calculations}

Two measures of carbon conversion are discussed in this memo.  The first is the fraction of carbon in the biomass which is converted to either CO or CO$_2$, as these are the two species which are the precursor to synthetic liquid products in the planned commercial process.  This measure is refered to as carbon yield, although it has been referred to in the past as good conversion, and is given in Equation \ref{eq_c_yield}.

\begin{equation}
	Y_{CO+CO_2} = \frac{\dot{n}_{CO,out}+\dot{n}_{CO_2,out} - \dot{n}_{CO_2,in}}{\dot{n}_{C_{biomass},in}}
	\label{eq_c_yield}
\end{equation}

The second measure is carbon release, which has been referred to in the past as total conversion.  This was calculated using Equation \ref{eq_c_release} and is a representation of the fraction of carbon in the biomass which is converted to any gaseous specie detected by the mass spectrometer.

\begin{equation}
	X_{C} = \frac{\dot{n}_{C_{gas},out}- \dot{n}_{CO_2,in}}{\dot{n}_{C_{biomass},in}}
	\label{eq_c_release}
\end{equation}

Tar loading is a measure of the mass of tars detected by the mass spectrometer (C$_6$H$_6$, C$_7$H$_8$, and C$_{10}$H$_8$) in a standard volume of product gas.  This value was calculated using Equation \ref{eq_tar}.

\begin{equation}
	C_{tar} = \frac{\dot{m}_{C_6H_6}+\dot{m}_{C_7H_8} + \dot{m}_{C_{10}H_8}}{\dot{V}(\frac{P}{P_{std}})(\frac{T_{std}}{T})}
	\label{eq_tar}
\end{equation}

Finally, the last measure discussed in this memo is methane yield.  It is a representation of the fraction of carbon in the biomass which is converted to methane, and it was calculated using Equation \ref{eq_ch4}.  A table defining all variables used in this memo can be found in Appendix \ref{app_var}.

\begin{equation}
	Y_{CH_4} = \frac{\dot{n}_{CH_4}}{\dot{n}_{C_{biomass},in}}
	\label{eq_ch4}
\end{equation}

\section*{Results and Discussion}

Because only inlet conditions of the reactants were needed to calculate the maximum residence time, the experimental matrix was designed based on this calculation.  Once experiments were completed and outlet conditions were known, a minimum residence time could be calculated assuming all products reached the wall temperature of the reactor and reacted fully immediately upon entering the reactor.  In reality, the actual residence time  was somewhere between these boundaries, and the actual residence time would be very difficult to estimate with the data known from the experiments.  

Plotted results are shown in Appendices \ref{app_plots_cyield}, \ref{app_plots_crel}, \ref{app_plots_tar}, and \ref{app_plots_ch4} for carbon yield, carbon release, tar loading, and methane yield using both the maximum and minimum residence times for visualization purposes.  ANOVA results are shown using only minimum residence time.  While the magnitude of the effects may be slightly different when using either minimum or maximum residence time, the time chosen for analysis does not change which factors are shown to be statistically significant when using ANOVA.

\subsection*{Carbon Yield}

Carbon yield results are plotted in Figures \ref{maxrt_vs_cyield}, \ref{minrt_vs_cyield}, \ref{dh_vs_cyield_maxrt}, and \ref{dh_vs_cyield_minrt} in Appendix \ref{app_plots_cyield}.  ANOVA results are given in Table \ref{anova_cyield}, and factors which had a statistically significant effect on carbon yield are highlighted in red.  At 1350 $^\circ$C, minimum residence time was not statistically significant while $\Delta H_{Max}$/A was.  Both minimum residence time and $\Delta H_{Max}$/A were statistically signficant at 1450 $^\circ$C.  However, as shown in the aforementioned plots, higher residence times led to lower carbon yields, if there was an effect.  Since it is very unlikely that the reaction would proceed backwards and lead to lower conversions at longer residence times, it's likely that the effect did not exist, or that another factor was correlated with the changing residence times that is causing the difference in calculated carbon yields.  Further tests may be held in the future holding different factors constant to see what is actually driving the variance.

\subsection*{Carbon Release}

Carbon release results are plotted in Figures \ref{maxrt_vs_crel}, \ref{minrt_vs_crel}, \ref{dh_vs_crel_maxrt}, and \ref{dh_vs_crel_minrt} in Appendix \ref{app_plots_crel}.  Results from ANOVA, shown in Table \ref{anova_crel} reflected what was seen in carbon yield measurements.  The total maximum enthalpy load was a significant factor in the carbon release at both 1450 $^\circ$C and 1350 $^\circ$C.  Again, while minimum residence time was statistically significant at 1450 $^\circ$C, longer residence times actually gave lower conversions.  Since this result contradicts kinetic considerations, further tests may be completed in the future to see if some other factor correlated with the changing residence times was causing the apparent dependency of conversion on residence time.

	\caption{ANOVA results on effects of designed experimental campaign for carbon release.}

	\end{tabular}
	\label{anova_crel}

\subsection*{Tar Loading}

Figures \ref{maxrt_vs_tar}, \ref{minrt_vs_tar}, \ref{dh_vs_tar_maxrt}, and \ref{dh_vs_tar_minrt} in Appendix \ref{app_plots_tar} show the results for tar loading values from each experiment in the campaign.  Longer residence times and lower enthalpy loads appear to have led to lower tars at 1350 $^\circ$C.  ANOVA results shown in Table \ref{anova_tar} show that both residence time and $\Delta H_{Max}$/A had statistically significant effects on the amount of tars produced at 1350 $^\circ$C, but not at 1450 $^\circ$C.  This is similar to past results at 1450 $^\circ$C where the tar levels were on the same order of magnitude as the variance between runs, so conclusions about difference in tar levels cannot be made.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{ANOVA results on effects of designed experimental campaign for tar loading.}
	\begin{tabular}{r c c}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\multirow{2}{*}{Effect}}		& 	\multicolumn{2}{c}{Prob \textless F	}	\\
		{}								&	1350 $^\circ$C	&	1450 $^\circ$C			\\
		\midrule
		t$_{res,min}$						&	\textcolor{red}{\textless 0.0001}	&	0.0654			\\
		$\Delta H_{Max}$/A					&	\textcolor{red}{0.0015}			&	0.8029			\\
		t$_{res,min}\times \Delta H_{Max}$/A	&	\textcolor{red}{0.0002}			&	0.2309			\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{anova_tar}
\end{table}

It is important to note that residence time had a significant effect on tar loading at 1350 $^\circ$C, but it did not have a significant effect on conversion measures at this temperature.  There is a reasonable physical explanation for this.  While the reactions that contribute to the conversion measures span the entire temperature range (280 $^{\circ}C$ to 1300 $^{\circ}$C), those that are involved in refractory tar cracking do not have measureable rates until the gas reaches 900 $^{\circ}$C or 1000 $^{\circ}$.  Due to the exponential relationship of reaction kinetics to temperature, most of the reactions contributing to the carbon yield and carbon release figures would have very high rates at temperatures where the rate of tar cracking would be low.  As these lower temperature reactions are endothermic, they would realistically need to complete themselves before the temperature was able to achieve conditions where tar cracking was important.  Indeed, it is the exponential dependence of kinetics on temperature that is the reason for the heat transfer limitation -- if heat transfer is not limiting, the temperature of a fluid parcel would rise until it either was the limiting factor or the parcel was at the wall temperature.  If the heat transfer were to be greatly reduced near the exit of the furnace (either due to a lower driving force ($\Delta$T) or a reduced number of radiation absorbers), the temperature could hover in the range where kinetic limitations were important for tar cracking.  

The experimental evidence does suggest this.  The tar levels decrease both with residence time and with heat duty.  If it were kinetics alone and the material were close to the wall temperature, only residence time would matter.  The dependence on heat duty suggests that exit temperature is important in determining the final level of tars in the system.  From a reactor development perspective, there are two pathways that could be chosen to reduce the impurity level.  The first would be to increase residence time.  However, this would restrict one to the kinetic rate curve at the temperature determined by the slowed rate of heat transfer.  The second would be to improve heat transfer.  This would have the advantage of increasing the temperature, greatly improving the kinetic rates and reducing the residence time requirements for cracking.  As the major conversion curves only depend on heat duty and improving heat transfer does have an affect on the impurity level, it is recommended that the focus be on heat transfer improvement.

\subsection*{Methane Yield}

Methane yield showed similar results as tar loading.  Results are shown in Figures \ref{maxrt_vs_ch4}, \ref{minrt_vs_ch4}, \ref{dh_vs_ch4_maxrt}, and \ref{dh_vs_ch4_minrt} in Appendix \ref{app_plots_ch4}.  ANOVA results, shown in Table \ref{anova_ch4}, show that both residence time and $\Delta H_{Max}$/A were statistically significant for methane yield at 1350  $^\circ$C as well as 1450  $^\circ$C.  Longer space times and lower enthalpy loads led to lower methane yields at both temperatures.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{ANOVA results on effects of designed experimental campaign for methane yield.}
	\begin{tabular}{r c c}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\multirow{2}{*}{Effect}}		& 	\multicolumn{2}{c}{Prob \textless F	}	\\
		{}								&	1350 $^\circ$C	&	1450 $^\circ$C			\\
		\midrule
		t$_{res,min}$						&	\textcolor{red}{\textless 0.0001}	&	\textcolor{red}{0.0001}	\\
		$\Delta H_{Max}$/A					&	\textcolor{red}{\textless 0.0001}	&	\textcolor{red}{0.0065}	\\
		t$_{res,min}\times \Delta H_{Max}$/A	&	\textcolor{red}{0.0009}			&	0.1305				\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{anova_ch4}
\end{table}
 
As with the tar cracking reactions, methane cracking reactions do not have appreciable rates until very high temperatures ($>$1100 $^{\circ}$C).  For many of the same reasons described above, the dual dependence on heat duty and residence time is likely a very tight balance between limiting heat transfer and energy consumption by reaction.  If the rate of heat transfer could be improved, the system temperature would rise until a new equilibrium was established at a higher temperature where the reaction rates were much faster.  Previous experimentation and kinetic models showed that exit temperatures of 1200 $^{\circ}$C to 1250 $^{\circ}$C would be sufficient to remove essentially all methane.  The fact that the dependence on either residence time or heat duty is essentially eliminated at 1450 $^{\circ}$C suggests that at the higher temperature the additional driving force is enough to lift temperatures above the threshold for fast cracking.

\subsection*{Normalized Heat Duty}

One good test to see if the carbon conversions are driven by heat transfer is to normalize the heat duty by dividing it by the temperature of the reactor wall to the fourth power.  Since previous heat transfer tests have shown that the actual wall temperature is about 50 $^\circ$C lower than what is measured by the skin thermocouples during normal operation, the temperatures were lowered by 50 $^\circ$C.  Graphs showing carbon yield and carbon release plotted against this normalized heat duty are found in Appendix \ref{app_norm} in Figures \ref{normalized_cyield} and \ref{normalized_crel}.

\section*{Conclusion}

Experiments showed that residence time did not have an effect on carbon conversion.  While residence time showed a statistically significant effect on carbon yield and carbon release at 1450 $^\circ$C, the effect is opposite of what has been observed in the past and may be due to another untested factor correlated with residence time in the experimental design.  There was no statistically significant effect of residence time on either measure of conversion at 1350 $^\circ$C.  Heat duty, on the other hand, had a significant effect on carbon conversion at both temperatures.

Residence time did, however, have an effect on tar loading at 1350 $^\circ$C and methane yield at both 1350 $^\circ$C and 1450 $^\circ$C.  Longer times led to lower amount of the undesired products.  Effects that enthalpy load had on tar and methane production mirrored those displayed by residence time.

Future experiments should be completed which will hold different factors constant throughout the experimental campaign.  Additionally, the conversions seen for given enthalpy loads are lower than previous gasification experiments.  The biomass used in these experiments is from a different production run.  Experiments will be completed in the near future that repeat previous experimental set points with the new biomass to compare the results with old biomass.  If results come back with different conversions, then old biomass will be used under the same conditions to see if there has been a change in the system recently.
